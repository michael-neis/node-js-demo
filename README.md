READMEs are the first stop of technical documentation for SCS engineers. 

A well design readme is like a user manual

It should provide the reader/engineer with enough information to get started on their work, such as:

* An overview of what the repo is about

* the source code organization

* Deployment pipeline details info - How what each of the workflows does 

* How the code work / How to use it

* How to contribute to the source code repo

* etc.

## Contribution <a id="contribution"></a>

> [!CAUTION]
> * This repo has one branch: **main**
> * **This repo DO NOT allow direct push to main branch.**
> * *Changes should be made on a feature branch only then merged to main after review and approval*
